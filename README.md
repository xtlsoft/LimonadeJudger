# LimonadeJudger

LimonadeJudger is a lite-weight, simple but useful judger for OI.

## Build

We recommend you to build it with `clang`.

We've provided a build script. You can use it by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
chmod +x build.sh && ./build.sh
```

## Running a simple test 

```bash
# make sure you are root
cd build && ./judge.out
```
